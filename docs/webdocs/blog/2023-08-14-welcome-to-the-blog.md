# Site Update

Welcome! This week, I've decided I'd dedicate a substantial amount of my attention toward getting the documentation finished for version 1 of this API.

In addition to the ordinary documentation, I've decided to create a blog since [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) makes it so easy. Astro is a good framework, but this hobby project doesn't necessitate something so custom.

# Beta changes

I've added some struct tags to our structs to serialize properties to lowercase names. This is not a meaningful change, but it's a change I didn't want to go untracked. You can view the [commit](https://github.com/jackjohn7/Community-BOSS-API/commit/a75a4d8da5f7d6b4f0796e8383b61e25c143bd24) for more information.
